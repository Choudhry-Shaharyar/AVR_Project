# (AVR programming) Digital_Input_Project 

## Components list:
- SNAP Debugger PG164100
- Seeedstudio Grove beginner board (ATMEGA328p)	
- MPLAB X IDE

## Overview:
This project provides a clear understanding of AVR programming and digital inputs.\
Uses MPLAB X IDE and C we to communicate instructions to the ATMEGA328P microcontroller.\
Manipulates the ports, pins, and registers to display an ouput on demand.\
The SNAP debugger will allow communication to occur between your code and ATMEGA328p.

## Function:
